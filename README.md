# Flood-Prediction-Using-ML
 We propose this application that can be considered a useful system since it helps to reduce the limitations obtained from traditional and other existing methods.In proposed system, we implement a Machine Learning algorithms for getting insights from the complex patterns in the data in order to predict the floods. This technique is computationally inexpensive because of its simple architecture.
 Developed a Web Application For Performing All ML Algorithms on The Dataset.
 Skills Used :- Python, Html, ML Algorithms (KNN,Decision Tree,XG Boost, Logistic Regression Etc.
